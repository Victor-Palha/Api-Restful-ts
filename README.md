# Api Restful with TypeScript
***
**Install packages and dependencies**
***
## Start the project with command line.
    * `npm init -y` & ` tsc --init`
* Now, we gonna install the dependencies for development and separate they from dependencies like **express**
    * `npm install config dotenv express express-validator mongoose morgan winston` - (These dependencies are not for development state!)
    * `npm install @types/config @types/express @types/mongoose @types/morgan @types/node ts-node-dev typescript --save-dev` - (They are!)
* With all dependencies installed, we create one folder called `src` and inside, create one file called `app.ts`
* To hot reload of the application, inside of `package.json` we gonna write inside of `script` this code -> `"dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/app.ts"`
* To test, we gonna write a simple line on **app.ts**, this line is just a classic "HELLO WORLD". `console.log("Hello World From Node")`
* Your project folder should be like this:
![folder](img-reposi/folder.png)

(Observation: .gitignore, .gitattribute, README.md and img-reposi are for this repository where you are reading, so you can ignore in your project!)

* Let's run our project in command line, call the script *dev*: `npm run dev`

***
## Integrating express
***
* Let's start express on `app.ts` importing the modules, create middleware to accept JSON data and start the server.
    * We are using the module *config*, then we gonna create one folder called `config` and create a file called `default.ts` to store sensitive variables.
    * Inside the file we export the variables, creating one object like that:
    * ![config](img-reposi/config.png)
    ```ts
    export default {
        port: 3000,
    }
    ```
* Now we import to ours main file.
```ts
import express from "express"
import config from "config"

const app = express()

//JSON middleware
app.use(express.json())

// Config PORT
const port = config.get<number>("port")


app.listen(port,async()=>{
    console.log(`Server online on port: ${port}`)
})
```

***
## API test routes
***
* To start with routes, we gonna create a new file called `router.ts` inside the file *src*.
* With the file created, let's import functionalities from express, start the code creating one variable to recibe the this functionalities.
![router](img-reposi/router.png)

* Okay! now we wanna create the first router from this project!
    * **First i gonna to remember you that this is a outer filer, so we need to export to our main file!**
* The syntax is not much difference that we already seen, but we need to export each one of ours routers! like that:
```ts
export default router.get("/test", (req:Request, res:Response)=>{
    res.status(200).send("API working!")
})
``` 
* Your file should be like this:
![router2](img-reposi/router2.png)

* Now to finish, let's back to our main file `app.ts` and import our router!
```ts
//Router
import router from './router'
app.use("/api/", router)

```
* Now, all routers arriving from the `routes` receives the prefix /api/
* Your `app.ts` should be like this:
![mainFile](img-reposi/main.png)
***
## Creating database with MongodoDB Atlas
***
* First thing you need to do is create a account on MongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
* Then you need create a database on mongoDB Atlas, i don't gonna explain all to you how to do this, but you can read how to do on offical documentation from mongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/databases/) 
* BUT i gonna show you how to do it in a simple way!

1. Create a **new project**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/1.jpg)

2. Choice a **name** and click in **next**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/2.jpg)

3. Click in **create project**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/3.jpg)

4. Then in **DATABASES**, click in **Build Database**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/4.jpg)

5. Choice the plain **free**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/5.jpg)

6. Just click in **Create Cluster**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/6.jpg)

7. Go to **Network Acess**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/7.jpg)

8. Click in **Add IP Address**, then click in **Add Current IP Adress** and **confirm**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/8.jpg)

9. Go to **Database Acess** and click in **Add New Database User**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/9.jpg)

10. Choice one name to our user and click in **Autogenerate Secure Password**, copy the password and user name to one safe place... We gonna need this later
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/10.jpg)

11. In the end just gonna click in **Add User**
![tuto](img-reposi/mongo/11.jpg)

I strongly recommend you reed the documentation to know what are you doing!

***
## connecting to database
***
First let's to mongoDB website and copy the URL from our database!
1. Go to **databases** and click on **Connect**
![db](img-reposi/mongo2/1.jpg)
2. Then click in **Connect your application**
![db](img-reposi/mongo2/2.jpg)
3. Finally **copy the URL** from your database
![db](img-reposi/mongo2/3.jpg)

* Creating configs to database
    * Now we have the URL from ours database, so lets go to file of configurations that we created previously `config/default.ts`.
    * Inside of object he already created, let's create a new variable called `dbUrl` and it gonna receive our URL.
        * `dbUrl: "mongodb+srv://AshPalha:<password>@cluster0.xdzpwwf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"`
    * ![db](img-reposi/mongo2/dbconfig.png)
        * Then we gonna change were is `<passworld>` to yours password that we generate!
* Creating connection to database
    * Now let's create one file called `db.ts` in `config` folder.
    * Import two modules we installed on the beginning of the project: `mongoose` and `config`
        * ```ts
            import mongoose from "mongoose"
            import config from "config"
            ```
    * Now we gonna create one *async function* to connect, called **connect**
    * Then we gonna catch our URL to database using the module `config`.
        * `const url = config.get<string>("dbUrl")`
    * Done it we create a Try Catch to connection to tratament for errors!
        * ```ts
                try {
            
                } catch (err) {
                    
                }
        ```
    * Inside the Try, we gonna call from mongoose and use one method called `connect` and pass our URL as parameter.
        * ```ts
            await mongoose.connect(url)
            console.log("Successful connection to database!")
        ```
    * Inside the catch, we just gonna make a log to the error!
        * ```ts
            console.log("Error to connect to database")
            console.log(`Error: ${err}`)
        ```
    * Now we export the function!
        * `export default connect`
    * ![db](img-reposi/mongo2/connection.png)
* Importing to main file!
    * Inside of `app.ts` we gonna make two modifications.
    * First we gonna import the file `db.ts`.
        * `import db from "../config/db"`
    * Second on the `listen` we gonna call db as `await`, in this way the application just gone run if was connect to the database!
    * ![db](img-reposi/mongo2/import.jpg)
***
## Creating environment variables
***
* We gonna create one file to keep yours sensitives varibles, like API key, Database password etc...
    * First on root, create one file called `.env`.
    ![dotenv](img-reposi/env.png)
    * Inside of file we keep any variable what we want.
    * In your case, lets keep the *username* and *password* from database for now
    * Observation: **The variables always are in upcase**
        * Like that: `VAR_NAME=data`
    * Observation 2: **If you want to post your pessoal project on GitHub, on `.gitignore` put the file `.env` inside! I don't gonna do that because i want you to learn from this!**
    * For you see better, this is the code:
    ![dotenv](img-reposi/env2.png)
    * Remember to change this variables to yours, this variables are from my fictional database from this repository!
* Now let's go to `config/default.ts` and call ours environment variables!
    * But first we need to call the module `dotenv`, so let's go to `src/app.ts` and in the first line call the module.
        * `require("dotenv").config()`
        ![dotenv](img-reposi/dotenv.png)
    * To call the variables from file `.env` in `config/default.ts` we use the function `process.env.NAME_FROM_VARIABLE`
    * We gonna keep the two of yours variables on constants
        * Like that: 
        ```ts
            const db_name = process.env.DB_NAME
            const db_pass = process.env.DB_PASS
        ```
    * Then in variable `dbUrl` let's concatenate on the string
    ```ts
    const db_name = process.env.DB_NAME
    const db_pass = process.env.DB_PASS
    export default {
        port: 3000,
        dbUrl: `mongodb+srv://${db_name}:${db_pass}@cluster0.xdzpwwf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
    }
    ```
    ![dotenv](img-reposi/concatenate.png)
***
## Integration of Wiston
***
* To start with Wiston, we need understand what are this!
    * We gonna use Wiston to improve ours LOGS on terminal

* So let's create a new file called `logger.ts` on folder `config`
    * Now let's import theses modules: `config` and `winston`
    ![looger](img-reposi/logger/logger1.png)
    * You can read more about **Winston** [here](https://kimsereylam.com/typescript/2021/12/03/winston-logger-with-typescript.html)

* Now we go to `config/default.ts` and we gonna create one other attribute on ours object
    * The new attribute is called `env` and receive on string on value `development`.
        * `env: "development"`
        * ![logger](img-reposi/logger/logger2.png)

* Done this, we go back to file `logger` and we gonna create a series of configs that gonna describe how our application will behave.
    * First we create a object called `levels` that gonna describe the level of errors of ours aplication!
    ```ts
    const levels = {
        error: 0,
        warn: 1,
        info: 2,
        http: 3,
        debug: 4
    }
    ```
* Now let's create one variable what's going to call one function to receive what environment we are working!
    * The variable is called `level` and gonna receive ours `env` from `config.ts` and validate the information
    ```ts
    const level = ()=>{
        const env = config.get<string>("env") || "development"
        const isDevelopment = env === "development"
        return isDevelopment ? "debug" : "warn"
    }
    ```
    * The function going to return or `debug` or `warn` to us!

* Now we going to create one object to receive colors for ours error
    * The object is equal to `levels` but going receive string of colors
    ```ts
    const colors = {
        error: "red",
        warn: "yellow",
        info: "green",
        http: "magenta",
        debug: "white"
    }
    ```
    * Now we add this colors on Winston.
        * `wiston.addColors(colors)`

* Now we going to format ours log messages.
    * This format are from the log message that going to appers in ours terminal
    * Let's put the time, color and message
    ```ts
    const format = winston.format.combine(
        winston.format.timestamp({ format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss" }),
        winston.format.colorize({ all: true }),
        winston.format.printf(
            (info) => `${info.timestamp} - ${info.level}: ${info.message}`
        )
    )
    ```

* Now we gonna create others constants to create erros files
    * We going to use one method from Winston called `transports`.
    * This transports are to create files from erros, we can organize ours erros by folders if we want.
    ```ts
    const transports = [
        new winston.transports.Console(),
        new winston.transports.File({
            filename: "logs/erros/error.log",
            level: "error"
        }),
        new winston.transports.File({filename: "logs/all.log",})
    ]
    ```

* Okay, we create where the logs are, now we need to instance all of this!
    * We pass one object with all variables that we create!
        1. level
        2. levels
        3. format
        4. transports
    ```ts
    const Logger = winston.createLogger({
        level: level(),
        levels,
        format,
        transports
    })
    ```
    * Now we export the `Logger`

* To finish we can import this in any file we want.
    * To call Logger, we replace the `console.log()` to `Logger.info() / Logger.error() / Logger.warn()` and etc...
    ![logger](img-reposi/logger/logger3.png)
    ![logger](img-reposi/logger/loger5.png)
***
## Configurating Morgan
***
* Start with Morgan.
    * The *Morgan* will make our log be more complete
    * First we going to create one folder to middleware on `src`
    * Then creating one file called `morganMiddleware.ts`
    * Now we going import inside the file ours modules.
    ```ts
    import morgan, {StreamOptions} from "morgan";
    import config from "config"
    import Logger from "../../config/logger";
    ```
* Creating config to morgan
    * After we import ours modules, let's create objects to read http requests
    ```ts
    const stream: StreamOptions = {
        write: (message)=>Logger.http(message)
    }
    ```
    * After this, let's create one validation to skip if are in development environment
    ```ts
    const skip = ()=>{
        const env = config.get<string>("env") || "development"
        return env !== "development"
    }
    ```
    * Now we going create one instance of class morgan and join the valiables that we create and in the end we export.
    ```ts
    const morganMiddleware = morgan(
        ":method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms",
        {stream, skip}
    )

    export default morganMiddleware
    ```
* Import morgan to other files
    * Go to our main file `app.ts` and import morgan.
        * `import morganMiddleware from "./middleware/morganMiddleware"`
    * Now let's make this middleware be in level of application!
        * `app.use(morganMiddleware)`
    * To test i going use Thunder Client to make HTTP request to our API,
    ![thunder-client](img-reposi/morgan.jpg)
***
## Creating Model
***
* Working with MVC (Model View Controller)
    * To start lets configure our *models*
    * Let's create one folder on `src` called `models`
    * let's insert the entities that will allude to our collections of our database
* Start Model
    * In the folder what we create, lets create one file called `Movie.ts`
    * Whenever we create a new model on TypeScript we going import `model` and `Schema` from mongoose if you are using `mongoDB`
        * `import {model, Schema} from "mongoose"`
* Creating Schema
    * Let's create a Schema! This schema is a object with all properties we gonna insert on database
    ```ts
    const movieSchema = new Schema({
        title: {type: String},
        rating: {type: Number},
        description: {type: String},
        director: {type: String},
        stars: {type: Array},
        poster: {type: String}
    },
    {
        timestamps: true
    })
    ```
    * Now we export.
        * `export const MovieModel = model("Movie", movieSchema)`
***
## Creating Controller
***
* Start with controllers
    * In `src` we going to create a folder called `controllers` and inside of folder, let's create one file called `movieControllers.ts`
    * Inside of this file we going to work with express, so let's import it
        * `import {Request, Response} from "express"`
    * After this, let's import our Model that we create in last session.
        * `import { MovieModel } from "../models/Movie"`
    * Now to finish ours imports, let's import our `Logger`
    ```ts
    import {Request, Response} from "express"
    //Model
    import { MovieModel } from "../models/Movie"
    // Logger
    import Logger from "../../config/logger"
    ```
* Funtions
    * Now we going create ours functions to creation, reading and etc...
    * Let's start with one creation function for the movie!
    * All functions going to be **Async** because we going work with database then we need to hold they response to proceed
* Creation Function and Link to Router
    * Let's create one simple function to test
    ```ts
    export async function createMovie(req:Request, res:Response){
        return res.status(200).send("Controller Working")
    }
    ```
    * Now let's go to file `src/router.ts`
        * Then let's configurate your router to new router.
        * In export router, let's create a new POST router and call ours function that we create
        ```ts
        //exporting routers
        export default router
            .get("/test", (req:Request, res:Response)=>{
                res.status(200).send("API is working!")
            })
            //New
            .post("/movie", createMovie)
        ```
        * Now the link between our controllers and routers are ready!
        * Then we can configure ours controller properly!
***
## Insert datas
***
* Let's go `controllers/movieControllers.ts`.
* inside of ours function, let's delete the return and replace to one **Try/Catch**.
    ```ts
    //Creation
    export async function createMovie(req:Request, res:Response){
        try {
            
        } catch (err) {
            
        }
    }
    ```
    * Inside of try let's create a variable to get the data from `request`.
        * `const data = req.body`
    * Now let's create other variable to receive our Model and insert in our database the `data`.
        * `const movie = awai MovieModel.create(data)`
    * Then we going to return one status code **201** and pass a JSON message of `data`, like that:
        * `return res.status(201).json(data)`
        ```ts
        export async function createMovie(req:Request, res:Response){
            try {
                const data = req.body
                const movie = await MovieModel.create(data)
                return res.status(201).json(movie)
            } catch (err) {
                
            }
        }
        ```
* Catch
    * Inside of `catch` we going pass a error log from Logger and type the error as `any`
    * The final code should be like that:
    ```ts
    export async function createMovie(req:Request, res:Response){
        try {
            const data = req.body
            const movie = await MovieModel.create(data)
            return res.status(201).json(movie)
        } catch (err:any) {
            Logger.error(`Error: ${err.message}`)
        }
    }
    ```
    * Now you can test using POSTMAN, ThunderClient or any other tool! In my case i'll use Thunder Client!
    ![insert](img-reposi/insert.png)
    ![insert](img-reposi/databaseColletions.png)
    (Okay, i wrote wrong Fellowship... you can judge me!)
***
## Express-validation
***
* We going create middleware to validation now using Express-validation
* This middleware will serve as a "joker" to deal with all validations of our system, after we will create validation to each one of ours entities.
* Let's start
    * In `middleware` folder, let's create a file called `handleValidation.ts`.
    * After creation let's import the modules.
        * ```ts
            import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express"
            import { validationResult } from "express-validator"
        ```
    * Now we'll create a middleware to take all `errors` from the next function that we will create and we'll treat they
* Create Middleware
    * Now let's create a *arrow function* in a variable called `validate`, like this:
    ```ts
    export const validate = (req:Request, res:Response, next:NextFunction)=>{
        //code...
    }
    ```
    * Inside of the function let's create a variable what's take erros from request, we going use the module *express-validator* on this variable
        * `const errors = validationResult(req)`
    * After this we will create a validation using `if` to see if our variable `erros` are empty or not.
        * ```ts
            if(errors.isEmpty()){
                return next()
            }
        ```
    * If are no erros on the application, the function `next()` is called and the application run normal!
    * But if are erros... We going create one array of objects to rescue all erros and return to user one bad request *(422)* from server and show all erros!
    * For theses erros we will use the method `map()` to go through all itens and push into our object.
        * ```ts
            export const validate = (req:Request, res:Response, next:NextFunction)=>{
                const errors = validationResult(req)

                if(errors.isEmpty()){
                    return next()
                }
                //Creating array empty
                const extratecErros: object[] = []
                //Push all erros into our array
                errors.array().map((err)=>{
                    extratecErros.push({[err.param]: err.msg})
                })
                //Return a bad request
                return res.status(422).json({
                    erros: extratecErros
                })
            }
        ```
* Import middleware
    * Let's go to `src/router.ts` and import our middleware
        * `import { validate } from "./middleware/handleValidation"`
    * Now let's put the `validate` inside the route `/movie`.
    ```ts
    export default router
    .get("/test", (req:Request, res:Response)=>{
        res.status(200).send("API is working!")
    })
    .post("/movie", validate, createMovie)
    ```
***
## Validating movies
***
* In this session we will finish the validation that we start in last session
* Start validation
    * Let's create another middleware `middleware/movieValidation.ts`
    * To start the file let's import the `body` from express-validator and create a function with name `movieCreateValidation`.
        * ```ts
            import { body } from "express-validator"

            export const movieCreateValidation = ()=>{
                
            }
        ```
    * Inside the function let's use the module `body` to make ours validation.
        * You can read the documentation of express-validator [here](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) and know all the methods of validation from this library.
* Create first validation.
    * Now we create the function, let's create a validation from the tittle of the movie.
    * We will return a Array to the validation.
    ```ts
    export const movieCreateValidation = ()=>{
        return[
            body("title").isString().withMessage("The title is mandatory")
        ]
    }
    ```
    * This function get the title from the Request and validation if are String if not generate a error with message "The title is mandatory"
    * This already are one validation and we can use import this on route that we will use, in ours case `src/router.ts` in router `/movie`.
        * ```ts
            .post("/movie", movieCreateValidation(),validate, createMovie)
        ```
    ![error](img-reposi/erro.png)
    * What's appears here is the middleware handleValidation get the errors from movieCreateValidation and show to user!
* Make better validations
    * You know now how to make validations with `express-validator` but until now we just make a title validation, let's make others!
    * As you probleby remember our Modal for database have this camps:
    * ```ts
        title: {type: String},
        rating: {type: Number},
        description: {type: String},
        director: {type: String},
        stars: {type: Array},
        poster: {type: String}
        ```
    * So we can validate any one! let's start with `rating`.
        * Just like the title we start the validate with `body("campName")`
        * `body("rating").isNumeric().withMessage("The rating must be a number!")`
        * The method `withMessage()` show the message if prerequisites are not being met
* Custom validators
    * With custom validators we can create one function inside the method `custom()` and make ours own validation.
    * Let's import from `express-validator` the method `CustomValidator`.
        * `import { body, CustomValidator } from "express-validator"`
    * Now let's create our validation by function!
    ```ts
    const ratingNote: CustomValidator = (value:number)=>{
        if(value < 0 || value > 10){
            throw new Error("The rating should be between 0 to 10!")
        }
        return true
    }
    ```
    * After we create the function, let's put on method `custom()`.
    ```ts
    export const movieCreateValidation = ()=>{
        return[
            body("title").isString().withMessage("The title is mandatory"),
            body("rating").isNumeric().withMessage("The rating must be a number!").custom(ratingNote)
        ]
    }
    ```
* Finish validations
    * To finish let's make validations to all camps from model inside the functions validation!
    ```ts
    export const movieCreateValidation = ()=>{
        return[
            body("title").isString().withMessage("The title is mandatory"),
            body("rating").isNumeric().withMessage("The rating must be a number!").custom(ratingNote),
            body("director").isString().withMessage("The director name is mandatory!"),
            body("description").isString().withMessage("The description is mandatory"),
            body("poster").isURL().withMessage("The poster must be URL!")
        ]
    }
    ```
